Here’s a clean **summary** you can use for docs, landing page, or investor decks for **Termind**.

---

## **What Termind Does**

**Termind** is a **privacy-first, AI-powered terminal** that runs entirely on your machine.
It automatically detects whether your input is a direct shell command or a natural-language query, and either:

* Executes it in your preferred shell (**bash**, **zsh**, **fish**, etc.), or
* Sends it to a **local AI agent** to explain, fix, or generate commands.

No internet connection is required — all AI runs locally by default.

---

## **Key Features**

### **1. Seamless Command/AI Detection**

* Type naturally — Termind decides if it’s a shell command or AI request.
* Override instantly with hotkeys (`Shift+Enter` for shell, `Cmd/Ctrl+I` for AI).

### **2. Block-Based History**

* Every command and output is saved as a **block** with timestamp, exit code, and context.
* Search, re-run, copy, share, or annotate individual blocks.

### **3. Local AI Assistance**

* **Propose Commands** — convert natural-language requests into ready-to-run commands.
* **Explain** — get plain-language breakdowns of any past command or error.
* **Fix** — AI suggests corrections, safer alternatives, or OS-specific versions.
* **Privacy-first** — redacts secrets before any AI call.

### **4. Ghost Block Confirmations**

* AI proposals appear as “ghost” blocks — review and approve before running.
* Risk labels (e.g., *writes\_to\_fs*, *network\_request*) highlight dangerous commands.

### **5. Active Error Assistance**

* Failed commands get an **inline “Explain / Fix / Safer”** banner.
* Common CLI tools (git, docker, kubectl, chmod, etc.) get specialized suggestions.

### **6. Custom Workflows**

* Save and reuse parameterized commands in simple YAML files.
* Palette (`Cmd/Ctrl+K`) for fuzzy searching workflows; AI can auto-fill arguments.

### **7. Searchable Command History**

* Full-text search across all past commands, outputs, and error messages.
* Filter to “failed only” for quick debugging.

### **8. Privacy & Security**

* Local-only mode by default.
* Explicit toggle for cloud models if desired.
* Sandboxed execution for AI-generated scripts/snippets.
* Safer rewrites by default for destructive operations.

### **9. Cross-Platform**

* macOS & Linux at launch.
* Support for bash, zsh, fish shells; Windows planned via ConPTY.

## **Who It’s For**

* **Developers** who want AI in their terminal without losing privacy.
* **DevOps/SREs** working in secure or air-gapped environments.
* **Teams** needing consistent, explainable CLI workflows.

If you want, I can also create a **feature comparison table** between Termind, Warp, and a traditional terminal so it’s clear where you stand out.
That could help for your site and pitch deck.
